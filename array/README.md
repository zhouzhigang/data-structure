# Arrays

## Overview

### What is an Array?
An array is a data structure consiisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

### Why is it important?
* Arrays are userd by almost every program. 
    * Used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings.
    * Used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices.
    * Used to implement all kinds of rectangular tables.
    * Used as records(one-demensional array) in many databases.
* Random Access

## Array Data Type
Assembly language: generally have no special support for arrays.
FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL 60, C had support for multi-dimensional arrays.


## Dynamic Array

C++: `std::vector`
Java/.NET: `ArrayList`
Smalltalk: `OrderedCollection`
Python: `list`
Ada: `Ada.Containers.Vectors`
Perl/Ruby: dynamic arrays as a build-in primitive data type
C frameworks: `CFArray`, `CFMutableArray` in Core Foundation; `GArray`, `GPtrArray` in GLib.
